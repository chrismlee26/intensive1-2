# Project

movieStillsAi is a fun website for movie and photography lovers to view their favorite images with AI generated
analysis data. What constitutes a beautiful image? What techniques are used in filming? What lighting and
composition contribute to a scene. Visit and find out

# Progress

Landing page is complete, along with most of the front-end functionality. The page so far is mostly composed of
state and event listeners. The JSON data was not used and all of the data is hard coded. A few more scenes will
be added along with a scroll-able gallery and full-screen viewer with the same analysis data. The navigation
functions will need to be fixed when this happens. The search was removed as there is only hardcoded data at the
moment.

# Goals

Would like to study what types of or combinations of neural networks & algorithms would be suitable to do this
type of analysis. How to organize this data, and be able to feed it on demand to users on the website. In the
short term, if there would be at least 100 scenes loaded in, it could actually be a fun little project for
friends and family to play along with. Would also like to get an actual upload working so users could submit
their own photos for analysis.
